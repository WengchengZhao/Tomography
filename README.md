Code for calculating $Tr(\rho^2)$: $TOMO-2G4rho$, $TOMO-2G9rho$, and Data processing for Tr(\rho^2)

The results obtained from $TOMO-2G4rho$ and $TOMO-2G9rho$ correspond to $Tr(R_{w_q})$ and $Tr(R_{w^{\prime}_q})$ respectively. Subsequently, the results are processed using the method described in this paper, and the code used for this purpose is labeled as Data processing for Tr(\rho^2).

Code for calculating $Tr(\rho^3)$: $TOMO-3G9rho$, $TOMO-3G16rho$, and Data processing for Tr(\rho^3)

Similarly, the outputs from $TOMO-3G9rho$ and $TOMO-3G16rho$ correspond to $Tr(R_{w_q})$ and $Tr(R_{w^{\prime}_q})$ respectively. Following the same procedure, the results are processed using the method described in this paper, and the code used for this purpose is labeled as Data processing for Tr(\rho^3).

Code for calculating $Tr(\rho^4)$: $TOMO-4G16rho$, $TOMO-4G25rho$, and Data processing for Tr(\rho^4)

Similarly, the outputs from $TOMO-4G16rho$ and $TOMO-4G25rho$ correspond to $Tr(R_{w_q})$ and $Tr(R_{w^{\prime}_q})$ respectively. Following the same procedure, the results are processed using the method described in this paper, and the code used for this purpose is labeled as Data processing for Tr(\rho^4).
